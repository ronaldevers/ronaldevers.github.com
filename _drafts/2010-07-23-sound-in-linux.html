'2010-07-23 07:58:41','Sound in Linux is a disaster. There are many different software packages (OSS, ALSA, PulseAudio, ESD, GStreamer etc.) and it is very hard for the beginner to figure out what he needs. It took me a while but I eventually worked it out. See <a href=\"http://4front-tech.com/hannublog/?p=5\">this opinionated post</a> on the history of sound in Linux by the creator of OSS. I will give a short recap here.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, long, long ago, there was OSS, the Open Sound System. It worked on many OS\'s including Linux. But then some Linux users created another sound API called ALSA, the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture and deprecated OSS. The creator of OSS joined a company called 4Front Technology to commercially develop OSS. Recently (2007 or 2008 I think), OSS was once again open sourced.\r\n\r\nLong story short, <em>ALSA sucks</em> and <em>OSS rocks</em>. I had many problems with ALSA, for instance it allowing only one audio source to play at one time. So I removed it altogether and installed the new OSS .deb from <a href=\"http://www.opensound.com/download.cgi\">4Front / opensound.com</a>. This instantly worked like a charm!\r\n\r\nFollow the excellent <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSound\">Ubuntu community guide</a> to install OSS on Ubuntu. If you have been following along with my previous post for a minimal install, then you don\'t have to remove PulseAudio, ALSA and GStreamer. Just do the linux-base-sound step and install the .deb from 4Front.\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re done, test sound with <code>osstest</code> or open a graphical mixer with <code>ossxmix</code>. To setup applications to use OSS, see <a href=\"http://www.4front-tech.com/wiki/index.php/Configuring_Applications_for_OSSv4]\">the 4Front wiki</a>.\r\n<h2>MPD</h2>\r\nNow rejoice! Or install <a href=\"http://musicpd.org\">MPD</a> with\r\n\r\n<code>sudo aptitude install mpd</code>.\r\n\r\nEdit <code>/etc/mpd.conf</code> after the install to point to your music directory, remove the ALSA output section and uncomment the OSS output section. Now tell it to do an initial scan of your music directory with\r\n\r\n<code>sudo /etc/init.d/mpd stop; sudo /etc/init.d/mpd start-create-db</code>.\r\n\r\nIt will probably also install <code>mpc</code>, a simple command line client for MPD. Try\r\n\r\n<code>mpc search artist astley | mpc add\r\nmpc play </code>.\r\n\r\nNormally PMS is a bad thing, but <a href=\"http://pms.sourceforge.net\">Practical Music Search</a> is not. It is a really cool and simple client for MPD. It is not available as a Ubuntu package as far as I know, so download and install from source. It should be a simple\r\n\r\n<code>configure &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code>.\r\n\r\nNote that you need glib2 and ncurses. So do\r\n\r\n<code>sudo aptitude install glib2-dev ncurses-dev</code>\r\n\r\nor something similar. When it is finished installing, just run pms and enjoy!','Sound in Linux','','publish','open','open','','sound-in-linux','','\nhttp://4front-tech.com/hannublog/?p=5','2010-07-23 07:58:41','2010-07-23 07:58:41','',0,'http://blog.ronaldevers.nl/?p=23',0,'post','',0);
