'2010-07-23 07:48:14','If you are on a Mac and using TextMate it is super-easy to get syntax highlighting on your blog. <a href=\"http://www.craigiam.com/blog/14/syntax-highlighting-for-your-blog-using-textmate!\">Craig Campbell\'s blog</a> has an excellent post on the topic. It turns out that you can just export HTML through the TextMate bundle (Bundles → TextMate → Create HTML From Selection). Just add (and maybe customize) the generated CSS to your blog and copy/paste your highlighted code as HTML from the TextMate generated output.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Markdown like I am, it is even more easy, because Markdown accepts plain old HTML tags so no thinking on my side is required whatsoever. Excellent!\r\n\r\nUpdate: I now use Wordpress and no longer use Markdown.','Blog syntax highlighting the lazy way','','publish','open','open','','blog-syntax-highlighting-the-lazy-way','','','2010-07-23 07:48:14','2010-07-23 07:48:14','',0,'http://blog.ronaldevers.nl/?p=10',0,'post','',0);
