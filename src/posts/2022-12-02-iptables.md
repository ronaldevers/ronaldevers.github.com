title: IPTables gotcha

## Device name with negation

IPTables will happily create a rule for an interface with a name that starts
with an exclamation mark like `!docker0`. But if you want to match traffic on
any interface except `docker0`, then you must put the exclamation mark before
the option and not before the name. So `! -o docker0` instead of `-o !docker0`.

This is documented in the manual but it's an easy mistake to make and it cost me
a bunch of time today!

Wrong:

```sh
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o !docker0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Right:

```sh
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ! -o docker0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Note both these rules will appear _exactly_ the same when listing the rules:

```sh
$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o \!docker0 -j MASQUERADE
$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING \! -o docker0 -j MASQUERADE
$ iptables -vt nat -L POSTROUTING
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
    0     0 MASQUERADE  all  --  any    !docker0  anywhere             anywhere
    0     0 MASQUERADE  all  --  any    !docker0  anywhere             anywhere
```
